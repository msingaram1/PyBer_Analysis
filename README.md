# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of Project
Ride data accross a large set of cities (urban, suburban, and rural) was collected and the analysis done summarizes the fare data in a digestable way. 

## Results
Results showed us that rural cities had the fewest amount of rides as well as drivers but had the largest average fare per ride/driver, suburban cities had the 2nd most amount of rides as well as drivers with the fare slightly less than the rural cities, and urban cities had the most amount of rides as well as drivers with the smallest fare per ride/driver.

Also the multi-line chart shows us that the same conclusion but throughout time.

## Summary
Based on these results, it is safe to assume that rural trips are longer and less frequent and urban trips are shorter, more frequent, and with higher demand, and suburban trips in the middle. To address these disparities among the city types one can:

   1. Finding the drivers within a certain range for shorter trips in urban and suburban areas to maximize number of trips given
   2. Maximizing rural trips by making sure drivers who are going far away get customers from the destinations of their prior trips.
   3. Decreasing rural prices by a certain percentage to increase total amount of trips while still having costs above that of suburban and urban counterparts.
